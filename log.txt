Brett:

    1. 0.75 Hrs || Input Parsing || The BBC Article Input needed to be parsed so that DocumentVectors could be created.
        The parsing consisted of splitting on the comma in the file's lines, as the format was a CSV, and each line in
        the file was a new document.

    2. 1.5 Hrs || ArticleVector Creation || The original implementation of the TextVector Abstract needed to be
        implemented by a new class, ArticleVector. This class was then adapted to fit the needs of this project, storing
        relevant data like its label and text.

    3. 3.5 Hrs || Find Closest Cluster || This is one of the larger sections of the project, as it required full
        iterations through the dataset to determine which cluster the current document was closest to.

    4. 1.0 Hrs || Performance Metrics || Using techniques learned in class, the precision, recall, and f1-scores were
        calculated given a hashmap of clusters.


Saurav:

    1. 2 Hrs || Updated Centroids Calculation || The code includes a function named getUpdatedCentroids which is 
        designed to compute the updated centroids. These centroids are derived from the ArticleVectors that are
        associated with clusters ranging from 1 to k.

    2. 2 Hrs || Comparing two Centroids || Created a method to compare two centroids based on their axis values.
        The method iterates through the provided two centroids and checks if there is any difference between them. 
        If no difference is found, it indicates that both centroids are identical.

    3. 1 Hrs || Developed a method to examine the distribution of categories once the centroid updating loop is
        completed. This analysis allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the centroids that were calculated based 
        on a random initial selection.


Blake:

    1. 1 Hrs || Design Work || Worked directly with Brett and Saurav to troubleshoot project organization issues and
        cooperatively create solutions from adjustment of scalar calculation to project redesigns.

    2. 2 Hrs || Refactoring Main || Adjusted the functionality of Main to include options to serialize generated objects
        to save time with further development. Developed methods to serialize and load objects easily.

    3. 3 Hrs || Efficiency Exploration || Looked into methods we could use to make model training more efficient and
        faster. Explored different organizations and calculations but settled on cluster consistency to avoid complete
        refactor.
