Brett:

    1. 0.75 Hrs || Input Parsing || The BBC Article Input needed to be parsed so that DocumentVectors could be created.
        The parsing consisted of splitting on the comma in the file's lines, as the format was a CSV, and each line in
        the file was a new document.

    2. 1.5 Hrs || ArticleVector Creation || The original implementation of the TextVector Abstract needed to be
        implemented by a new class, ArticleVector. This class was then adapted to fit the needs of this project, storing
        relevant data like its label and text.

    3. 3.5 Hrs || Find Closest Cluster || This is one of the larger sections of the project, as it required full
        iterations through the dataset to determine which cluster the current document was closest to.

    4. 1.0 Hrs || Performance Metrics || Using techniques learned in class, the precision, recall, and f1-scores were
        calculated given a hashmap of clusters.
